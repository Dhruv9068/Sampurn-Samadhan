## File Structure for Deployment

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _redirects          # Netlify redirects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logo.jpeg           # Company logo
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rekha 1.png         # Rekha before image
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rekha 2.png         # Rekha after image
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Source code
â”œâ”€â”€ netlify.toml            # Netlify configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts          # Vite configuration
```

## Important Notes

- The `_redirects` file ensures proper routing for SPA
- All images are served from the `public` folder
- The project uses Vite for building and development
- Tailwind CSS is configured for production builds

## Troubleshooting

- If images don't load, check the `public` folder path
- If routing doesn't work, verify `_redirects` file is in `public` folder
- For build errors, check Node.js version (should be 18+)
